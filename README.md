#  ColorPicker


A HSV Color Picker UIControl and a sample view controller as an example on how to use it. You can use the controller as-is in your own projects, or you could use the ColorPicker control instead. The control uses the standard target-action mechanism (via the UIControlEventValueChanged event). This is also the _spiritual_ successor to [KZColorPicker](https://github.com/alexrestrepo/KZColorPicker)
